## Introduction
The VOD backend microservice provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure to manage and deliver fun learning video content. It includes features such as user authentication, video content management, streaming, recommendations, and access control.

## Functional Requirements
- User Registration and Authentication: Users should be able to create accounts and authenticate themselves to access the VOD service.
- Video Content Management: Admins should be able to upload, manage, and categorize video content. Metadata such as titles, descriptions, age group, subject, difficulty level, and learning objectives should be associated with each video.
- Video Streaming and Playback: Users should be able to browse and search for video content and play videos with adaptive streaming based on their network conditions.
- Recommendations and Personalization: The system should provide personalized video recommendations based on user preferences, viewing history, and feedback.
- Access Control and Authorization: Different user roles and permissions should be implemented to control access to video content.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance and Scalability: The VOD microservice should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and video streams, with scalability to accommodate increased traffic.
- Reliability and Availability: The system should be highly reliable and available, minimizing downtime or service interruptions.
- Security: The system should ensure the security of user data and implement secure communication protocols and encryption techniques.
- Monitoring and Analytics: Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track system health, performance, and usage.
- Integration and Extensibility: The system should be designed to integrate with other services or APIs and be extensible for future enhancements.
